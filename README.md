# Overview

This is a simple notes app built with TypeScript. It runs in the terminal and lets the user add and view notes through a basic menu. The app uses classes, arrays, and a recursive loop to keep the interface running. It also includes an async function and basic exception handling.

The goal was to get comfortable with TypeScript syntax and structure by building a small working project.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
